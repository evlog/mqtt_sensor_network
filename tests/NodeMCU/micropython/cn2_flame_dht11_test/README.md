This folder contains a test code for cn2 and sensors.

In this test, the full stucture of the program is used. We test the flame and hum/temp sensors
Changes were made on "cn2_states.py" file and "sensors.py" was added.

The program follows its standard connection routine but also prints out sensor values when
in Active mode.
