This folder contains a test code for cn2.

In this test, the full stucture of the program is used. SSL is enabled as well as garbage collection and code optimization.
The program publishes and subscribes to full topics with full messages extracted from the XML file.
The main difference is that the umqtt package (simple.py) is pre-compiled. This reduces the memory consumption.
The program runs successfully without errors.

In this folder both "simple.py" and "simple.mpy" are included.
In order to run, use only the "simple.mpy"(compiled) script.
